My solutions for 2021 Advent of Code solutions. ~No special assumptions this year
just make solutions as simple as possible.~ Changed my mind. No mutations. Zero
mutable variables. Pure functional Rust. Everything would be done in rust. It would
prob kill me, but why not ;)

Current code stats would be generated with tokei.
