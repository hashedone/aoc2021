My solutions for 2021 Advent of Code solutions. ~No special assumptions this year
just make solutions as simple as possible.~ Changed my mind. No mutations
besides parsing. Zero mutable variables. Pure functional Rust. Everything would
be done in rust. It would prob kill me, but why not ;)

Mutable borrows are allowed unless I actually need to create mutable variables
(so implementing own iterator, or functions like `Iterator::scan` are ok).

Current code stats would be generated with tokei.
